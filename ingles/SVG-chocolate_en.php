<h1>Investing in Venezuelan Cocoa and Chocolate</h1>

<p>Many experts argue that the Venezuelan cocoa is the best in the world. 
Perhaps this statement does not give enough credit to the work that has 
been done in Ecuador, Peru and Colombia to gain the title of the country 
with the best cocoa in the world. However, though is true that the 
processes followed to obtain a cocoa deserving of the title of the best 
of the world in Venezuela have been neglected, we believe that the great 
variety of Venezuelan exquisite cocoa has no possible comparison in the 
world.</p> 

<p>Venezuela has historically been a producer of cocoa. But, sadly, 
Venezuela is no longer recognized as one of the best producers of 
cocoa of the world, basically for two main reasons: the boom of the 
oil industry and wrong policies.</p>

<p>However, the immense potential of Venezuela in this area is still there, 
particularly in regions where growing cocoa is part of ancient traditions 
that have always ensured the deserved reputation of Venezuelan cocoa and 
chocolate.</p>

<p>Moreover, in a context where the most valuable product is no longer a 
barrel of oil, cocoa is positioned as the best option for hundreds of 
families to overcome poverty: a pound of Venezuelan chocolate in any 
European market has a higher value than the value of a barrel of oil.
</p>

<p>Furthermore, today Venezuela has the cheapest labor of the world. 
Perhaps investing in the chocolate sector in Venezuela is not the best 
deal you can make; perhaps it isn't even delicious for you because you 
might not like chocolate, but we can assure you that it will be the best 
deal for you if you want to obtain dividends as well as the satisfaction 
of achieving social objectives.</p>
